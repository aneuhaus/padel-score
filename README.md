# Padel Scoreboard

## About

This is a simple scoreboard for padel matches. It is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Bohr](https://bohr.io).
Check the demo at [https://padel.bohr.app](https://padel.bohr.app).

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Astro projects are structured like most other web projects:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles/

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command             | Action                                           |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`      | Installs dependencies                            |
| `pnpm dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `pnpm build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `pnpm astro ...`    | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `pnpm astro --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
